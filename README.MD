# Lexical Fuzzing Project

This project contains implementations and learnings from the [Fuzzing Book](hhttps://github.com/uds-se/fuzzingbook/) course.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates practical applications of fuzzing techniques learned from the FuzzingBook course. Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program.

## Current Project Structure 

- `codeCoverage/`
  - `coverage.py` - Implementation of code coverage analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding basic fuzzing concepts
- Implementing lexical fuzzing techniques
- Analyzing code coverage during fuzzing
- Generating test inputs automatically
- Detecting software vulnerabilities through fuzzing
